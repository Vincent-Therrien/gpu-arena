# Metal

Metal is a graphics and general-purpose computing framework developed by Apple that targets GPUs. It
only works on Apple operating systems (Mac / iOS). Metal uses the MSL shading language.

I don't have an Apple device so I couldn't test it `:(`. Refer to the page
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/ if you want to know more!
