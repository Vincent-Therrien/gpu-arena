# Define a neutral element for the operation. This is used when there are more threads than elements
# to reduce. Some elements will be reduced with `0` when they cannot be paired with another element.

# The result of the sum follows a shifted Irwinâ€“Hall distribution. Since there are 10000 elements,
# std = sqrt(10000 / 3) ~ 57.7. So the sum will mostly fall in the range [-58, 58].
