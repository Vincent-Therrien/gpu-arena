# CPU

Implement the tasks in Rust and run them on multi-core CPUs.


## Build

- Install [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) on your system.
- Run the command `cargo build --release`.


## Usage

Run the command:

```
# Linux
./target/release/cpu --task <n>

# Windows
target\release\cpu --task <n>
```

where `<n>` is an integer ranging from 1 to 3, inclusively, that designates the task to execute.
Refer to the [root readme file](../readme.md) to view the tasks.
